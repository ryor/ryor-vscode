# Change Log

All notable changes to the "ryor-vscode" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.1] - 2024-09-10

### Added

- Initial TextMate language grammar files (.json file for use by extension created from .yaml source)
- Initial icons for both the extension and file explorer/other views (the latter a bit awkwardly left-padded with whitespace in order to line it up visually with other icons in the file explorer)
- Other files/values necessary for basic syntax highlighting extension
